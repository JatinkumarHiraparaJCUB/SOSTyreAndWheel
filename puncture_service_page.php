                <h3>So you've got a flat tyre, what happens now?</h3>
                <p>The most immediate action when you have a flat tyre is to discontinue driving. Proceeding to drive on a flat tyre will risk internal damage and seem it unrepairable. If possible, safely remove the punctured tyre and apply your spare (if available). Please note, it is absolutely crucial to arrange for the punctured tyre to be repaired as soon as possible! Particularly, if your vehicle's spare tyre is a space saver (or speed limited).</p>
                <h3>What constitutes a tyre repair?</h3>
                <p>A flat tyre is generally caused by a puncture to a tyre’s casing by sharp objects (e.g. small nails or screws), causing air leakage and/or deflation.
                    <br /> The location of the puncture will determine if the tyre is repairable. Normally, tyres with punctures within the tread area are repairable (see below for repair specifications).
                    <br /> However, tyres can often be beyond repair and will require a replacement if there are sizeable punctures to the tread or punctures in the tyre's shoulder or sidewall region.

                <h3>Repair area: </h3>
                <p>Areas within the central ¾ of a tyre (shown in green) which have a tread depth of no less than 1.6mm are minor repair areas.</p>
